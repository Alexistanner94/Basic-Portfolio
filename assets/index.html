<section> 
        My Name is Alexis Tanner, but my friends call me Lex! 
        I was borned and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, where
        I still currently reside. 
        A few of my many hobbies are eating, sleeping, 
        shopping, and traveling.  
        My next big trip is going to be to Bazil and I am so elated.
         I currently work for Best Buy's very own Geek Squad, as a Subject Matter Expert. 
         I have been with Geek Squad for almost three years and I learn something new everyday.
          My job is exciting because it allows me to exercise my problem solving and critical
         thinking skills with real-live senerios. Soon, I plan to start a tech company,
        mainly focusing my services on installations, web/program design, advertising, 
        software troubleshooting, and techical support.
