        <p> 
                My Name is Alexis Tanner, but my friends call me Lex! 
                I was borned and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, where
                I still currently reside. 
                A few of my many hobbies are eating, sleeping, 
                shopping, and traveling.  
                My next big trip is going to be to Bazil and I am so elated.
                 I currently work for Best Buy's very own Geek Squad, as a Subject Matter Expert. 
                 I have been with Geek Squad for almost three years and I learn something new everyday.
                  My job is exciting because it allows me to exercise my problem solving and critical
                 thinking skills with real-live senerios. Soon, I plan to start a tech company,
                mainly focusing my services on installations, web/program design, advertising, 
                software troubleshooting, and techical support.
